Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize
their audio aura?

A: I would characterize the audio aura of these 100 songs as "steady and groovy."
I reached this conclusion by first using Python with the cs50 library's SQL functionality to
retrieve the minimum, maximum, and average values for the energy, valence, and danceability
features from the songs table. Then, using Python code, I calculated where the average fell
within the range in the following way:

1. Span = Maximum Property Value - Minimum Property Value
2. Difference from Low = Average Property Value - Minimum Property Value
3. Percentage = (Difference from Low / Span) * 100

The resulting percentages were:
- Danceability: approximately 65%
- Energy: approximately 59%
- Valence: approximately 48%

Higher danceability, moderate valence, and energy somewhere in between the two led me to
characterize the audio aura as "steady and groovy."

Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative
of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

A: Approach with calculating averages like I did might mask if the user's top 100 songs can
hold values each closer to MIN or MAX value instead of AVG. Additional properties lile tempo
loudness, speechiness could be used. Maybe out of 100, the listener is playing his 20 favourites
much more frequently than the rest so we could count the play times for each song.

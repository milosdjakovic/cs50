# CLI TODO
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/o4RGluPaaZk
#### Description:
A CLI tool to manage and track TODOs. All data is preserved in CSV files in a separate directory for each repository.

The app supports multiple repositories. Each repository is a directory where your todo lists are stored as CSV files. Repositories can be created, deleted, viewed and selected by using command line arguments, or they can be created manually inside the `repositories` directory. The app will automatically detect any new repositories inside this directory (which gets created automatically if it doesn't exist).

When you start the app by passing a repository name as an argument (like `python cli-todo.py my-repo`), it loads any existing todo lists from that repository. You can then create, delete, rename, and select these todo lists using simple one-letter commands shown on screen.

Each TODO list is saved as a CSV file with the name of the list as the filename. The CSV file has 2 columns: one for the TODO title and the other for the completion status. Inside a list, you can create, delete, rename, and mark TODOs as done by toggling their status.

The entry point is `cli-todo.py` which uses modules organized in the `src` directory. The `src/arg_parser.py` handles command line arguments with options like `-c/--create`, `-d/--delete`, and `-l/--list`. It returns the repository name to work with or exits the program after performing an action like listing all repositories. The `src/repository_manager.py` manages the navigation menu for repositories, showing commands like select, add, rename, and delete. It connects user input to the `Repository` class methods and launches the `TodoManager` when a list is selected. The `src/repository.py` manages the CSV files within a repository. It handles file operations like creating, renaming, and deleting todo list files. The `src/todo_manager.py` handles user commands within a specific todo list, similar to how `RepositoryManager` works but for individual todos. The `src/todos.py` manages the CSV file contents, reading and writing todos to the file and providing methods to add, rename, toggle, and delete todo items. The `src/todo.py` represents a single todo item with a title and completion status, and provides methods to toggle its status. The `src/renderer.py` formats all the text output, with methods to create boxes around text, format todo items, display command menus, and clear the screen for better UI.

The only external module used is `pytest` for testing. The tests cover most parts of the application code, though testing the command line arguments has been challenging.

To improve the app, I was thinking managing them form within the app like TODO lists and TODOs themselves. The repository management is currently done through CLI arguments without starting the app itself because it was a bit easier to implement. Currently, navigating from list of TODOs to the TODO itself is achieved by the `RepositoryManager` instantiating a `TodoManager` and invoking its `render_todos()` method which will clear the screen and render the TODO list. When user goes back, the `render_todos` method will just return no value returning the flow to the `RepositoryManager` which will clear the screen and render the repository menu again. This is a bit clunky and could be improved by using some kind of navigation mechanism, which would potentially make room to implemented nested repositories and TODOs.

To further improve the app I could add sorting options for TODOs and lists (currently they appear in file system order), create a nicer UI with colors or more interactive elements, move repository management into the app instead of using command line args, add pagination for large numbers of TODOs or lists, allow adding descriptions to TODOs and lists, add the ability to rename repositories within the app (currently requires renaming the folder), and improve test coverage for command-line argument handling.
